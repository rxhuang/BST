Question 1.
testBST.cpp
BSTInt.cpp
BSTNodeInt.cpp
testBST.o BSTInt.o BSTNodeInt.o BST.hpp BSTNode.hpp BSTIterator.hpp

Question 2.
BSTInt.cpp: In function 'bool insert(int)':
BSTInt.cpp:25:8: error: 'root' was not declared in this scope
   if (!root) {
        ^
BSTInt.cpp:27:7: error: 'isize' was not declared in this scope
     ++isize;
       ^
BSTInt.cpp:31:22: error: 'root' was not declared in this scope
   BSTNodeInt* curr = root;
                      ^
BSTInt.cpp:56:5: error: 'isize' was not declared in this scope
   ++isize;
     ^
The error is saying that we have not declared the variables root and isize.
This occurs because if we do not use the name scope BSTInt, then we cannot use the variables we declared in BSTInt.h


Question3.
The bug was in the insertion function. The function does not always insert nodes to leaf nodes and it allows duplicates to be inserted if the duplicate node is a leaf node.

Question4.
I noticed there was somthing wrong when i was looking at the line "while(curr->left && curr->right)". This loop is intended to find the first node satisfying the BST property that has at most one child and the next part was to create a new node and add to this parent node. However, we are supposed to find the last node satisfying the BST property that has at most one child. So I changed the line to "while(curr->left || curr->right)" and got segmentatioin fault when I ran my tests. I then realized it was because it lets cur point to a child that may not exist. So, I added conditions to check if a child exists before I let cur point to it. Then I ran more test and when I got to my test called leafDuplicate, it failed by allowing me to add duplicates of a leaf node. I wen to the code and realized that the second part only had a condition for nodes smaller the parent but no condition for nodes greater than the parent, so I added a condition and everything worked fine.
